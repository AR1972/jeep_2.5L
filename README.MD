A repository of 91-95 Jeep and Dodge ECU EPROMS.

Currently used ECU's for 4 cylinder 91-95 Jeep are priced at $300-$500.
The purpose of this repository is to collect 4 cylinder Jeep EEPROMS
to cross flash to the much cheaper and plentiful 6 cylinder ECU's


Utilities to download and cross flash EEPROMs can be found in the
SBEC_utils\Release directory. A programming interface will need to 
be built from a USB relay board and a boost converter that can be
found on e-Bay or Amazon fairly cheaply. 


I am especially interested in 4 cylinder EEPROMS, for all years and models
of 91-95 Jeep and Dodge vehicles. Please submit a PR if you happen to find
or acquire one.


Capacitors:

Replacement electrolytic capacitors for these ECU's can be purchased through
Mouser, Digikey, etc. I prefer the Nichicon HE series with part numbers.

UHE1V471MHD6, UHE1V221MPD for the 35 volt variant and UHE1E221MPD1TD, 
UHE1E471MPD6TD for the 25 volt versions. Early ECU's had one 470uF and
two 220uF capacitors, while later ECU's have three 220uF all versions
used 25 volt capacitors, 35 volt capacitors have the advantage of being
in stock and will have a longer service life due to operating well under
half their rated voltage.
