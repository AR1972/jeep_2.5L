A repository of 91-95 Jeep and Dodge ECU EPROMS.

Currently used ECU's for 4 cylinder 91-95 Jeep are priced at $300-$500.
The pourpose of this repository is to collect 4 cylinder Jeep EEPROMS
to cross flash to the much cheaper and plentiful 6 and 8 cylinder ECU's

Any ECU of this vintage sould have it's capacitors replaced anyway, so 
pulling the EEPROM off the board and reading it's contents, for backup
purposes, should be a no brainer.

I am especally interested in 4 cylinder EEPROMS, for all years and models
of 91-95 Jeep and Dodge vehicles. Please submit a PR if you heppen to find
or aquire one.
