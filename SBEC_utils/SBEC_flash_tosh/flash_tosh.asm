; the Jeep Toshiba EEPROM's have 64 byte sectors, bytes to be programmed
; are loaded EVEN/ODD or ODD/EVEN, once the 64th byte to be programmed is
; loaded, or maybe the 65th, the chip begins writing the bytes. The first
; byte loaded determines if ODD ore EVENS are going to be loaded first.
; it is unclear if each sector is flashed after each load sequence, or
; just once after both ODD and EVEN bytes have been loaded.
