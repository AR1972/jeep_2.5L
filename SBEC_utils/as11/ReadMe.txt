These files constitute a 68HC11 cross assembler for the IBM PC.  In addition
a BASIC interpreter is contained in the file BASIC.OBJ.  This file, in the
S1 format, functions as a BASIC interpreter when executed out of ROM.

The assembler, AS11, recognizes standard Motorola assembler format for the
68HC11 and produces 'S1' object files.  The source code is included and can
be modified and compiled by Mark Williams C, Turbo C or Microsoft C.

AS11FST was complied using Mark Williams C and is faster than the original
Motorola complied object code (generated by Lattice C).  AS11 is the original
Motorola object file.

The assembler can also be used to generate code for the 6800, 6801 and 6802
if the special HC11 codes are not used.

This is a simple assembler and does not support linkable modules, but
otherwise is very complete and bug-free.  It works very well for small
projects.

These files were placed into the public domain by Motorola.
